  title: FINDING FINANCIAL FREEDOM IN AFGHANISTAN
  content: A pioneering female CEO has been promoting Bitcoin in Afghanistan since 2013 and sees it needed in her home country now more than ever. <br><br> Roya Mahboob — the first female Afghan tech CEO, one of TIME’s most influential people in the world and one of the first entrepreneurs to introduce Bitcoin to Afghanistan — was seven years old when the Taliban first took over her country and invaded her hometown in 1996. <br><br> One day she was playing with her bicycle in her front yard, wearing her favorite red scarf, when a bunch of armed men showed up in a jeep, screaming at her father in a language she did not understand.

  title: HOW ANITA POSCH BRINGS FINANCIAL EDUCATION TO THE WORLD - ‘BITCOIN GIVES THEM A CHOICE’
  content: Podcaster and non-profit educator Anita Posch discusses her mission to travel the world and bring Bitcoin to those who need it most. <br><br> As an American who grew up in the South, I am ashamed of the lack of financial knowledge I had as a young adult.

This knowledge has opened my mind to the many things that Bitcoin can accomplish in regards to elevating human rights around the world.
